# HW1Wireframe
The "easier" option.

This was our very first graded assignment for the University of Denver's Coding Bootcamp. Here, we were challenged to make a wireframe using CSS and HTML tags and boxes. This assignment is designed to give the coder a rough idea of what sizes and size issues come with HTML and CSS. To see this, you would need to download the repo and view the HTML file on your own local machine.
